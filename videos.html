    <h3>Understanding the importance of creativity and how to allow ourselves to be creative</h3>
    <p>"To express yourself, first you have to know yourself."</p>
    <p>"And if you get close to what you love, who you are is revealed to you and it expands."</p>

    <h3>Painting through a whole new dimension</h3> 
    <p>
        Jonna’s painting journey began out of a creative desire to communicate her heart with the world. In her Painting tutorial, she describes her 
        process making paint out of earth pigments. She explains how it took her a few years to find her own style, but ultimately her biggest inspiration
        remained nature. A constant change of seasons is reflected in her paintings that describe fall, winter, spring and summer. Out of curiosity, Jonna 
        started creating her own paint using natural materials such as blueberries, mud, charcoal, stones, and ashes. Although picking the materials and 
        creating the pigments took longer than expected, it made the creative process feel more meaningful and it gave her paintings a whole new dimension.

    <h3>Sculpture from a creative aspect </h3>
    <p>
        In the Pottery Studio Tour Video, YouTube Join Clark Underwood is on his quest to interview sculptor 
        Evan Horn who makes clay sculptures in Austin Texas. His creativity came from a place of limitation 
        during the pandemic when resources were harder to find. Horn took on the challenge and created sculptures
        out of collected Texas river clay. He describes how he works in a flow state where everything is spontaneous, 
        abstract, and intuitive. His works often start as a blob. Horn starts with the base and constructs from the ground up.  
        He has an idea in mind but gives it time to develop and ultimately allows the pieces to take their own shape.

    <h3>Creative writing workflow</h3>
    <p>
        Austin Kleon, author and artist, describes his creative workflow in a YouTube video called Making notebook maps. The idea of the maps is 
        to start in the center of the page and let the mind wander as it lists the things that inspire you during that month. Kleon describes how 
        this process is used by many authors to support new creative ideas and collect an expansion of new inspirations. The reason for this map is
         to challenge the mind to continue exploring even in a state of a “creative block”.  As it starts in the middle of the page and radiates out, 
         creativity is challenged to take inspiration from a variety of sources that ultimately can turn into a book, a poem, or a revolutionary paper.

    <h3>Expressing creativity through cinema</h3>
    <p> In the Behind the Scenes video, Thuydao shows how she uses creativity to plan, shoot and edit her vlogs. She describes how creativity does not have to use expensive material. She explains how the process of videography is about storytelling and the emotions that we try to convey. In that way, 
        being limited is a positive thing as it pushes us to create with what we got. She describes how small things like sound quality and light exposure can make a big difference in the way a story is being portrayed. She also suggests using as much natural light and spending time studying how other
        artists have used creativity to create beautiful scenes.</p>

    <h3>Creativity through Music</h3>
    <p>In the short documentary by The Sundrop Garden, June describes her connection to her stage name ((( O ))) and
    how it impacts her music in relation to creativity. She describes how when picking the name, she chose it to represent
    creation. Her music is guided by elements as a framework or a concrete playground where she places whatever she wants 
    into and sees it as an evolution of music as it transforms over the years. June describes music as an expression of her
    DNA. She uses creativity to record history as she navigates all the things she does not yet know about herself.</p>
